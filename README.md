# OOP Project in C++ using Linked List

## NOTE
Have added sample input, just put 
1. main.cpp
2. myheader.h
3. mysource.cpp

in one folder and execute the main.cpp file
Simply copy and paste everything from INPUTS.txt for a basic running of the program.
## Step 1:
Defined <myheader.h>
Contains the structure of the node
- 1. String USER, PASSWORD, NAME, ID, BATCH
- 2. float MARKS (array), TOTAL and AVERAGE
- 3. char GRADE
- 4. self referencing NODE for Address of the next node.

## Step 2:

Defined mysource.cpp
Defined basic functions:
- char Grade: to compute Grade based on float value
- void Initial: to intitalize any node
- void Input: to input the values of a node
- void ADD, REMOVE and MODIFY node
- node* find: to find a particular node with the matching 'NAME'
- void Display: 
- 1. Disp_Details for basic details except MARKS and RESULT
- 2. Disp_Result for displaying all subject marks, average and Pass/Fail status

## Step 3:

Defined main.cpp
- To execute the program, imports "mysource.cpp" and performs MENU DRIVEN PROGRAMMING
